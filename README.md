# cyclistic-bike-share

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this study, I performed an example of a real-world task as a junior data analyst. I used the dataset “divvy-tripdata” in this case. In order to answer the key business questions, I practiced the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. 

- I asked the right questions to help the company make data-driven decisions.
- Prepared the data by selecting and managing the appropriate dataset for the business task.
- Processed the data by cleaning it and checking its data integrity.
- Analyzed the data through exploration, transformation, and chart visualization to make relevant insights.
- Shared my conclusions and interpreted the results with the stakeholders.
- Acted on the data by giving some of my recommendations.
